Android SynchronizedNotifications Sample
===================================

A basic sample showing how to use simple or synchronized notifications.
This allows users to dismiss events from either their phone or wearable device simultaneously.

Introduction
------------

The [DataAPI][1] exposes an API for components to read or write data items and assets between
the handhelds and wearables. A [DataItem][2] is synchronized across all devices in an Android Wear network.
It is possible to set data items while not connected to any nodes. Those data items will be synchronized
when the nodes eventually come online.

This example presents three buttons that would trigger three different combinations of
notifications on the handset and the watch:

1. The first button builds a simple local-only notification on the handset.
2. The second one creates a wearable-only notification by putting a data item in the shared data
store and having a [com.google.android.gms.wearable.WearableListenerService][3] listen for
that on the wearable.
3. The third one creates a local notification and a wearable notification by combining the above
two. It, however, demonstrates how one can set things up so that the dismissal of one
notification results in the dismissal of the other one.

In the #2 and #3 items, the following code is used to synchronize the data between the handheld
and the wearable devices using DataAPI.

```java
PutDataMapRequest putDataMapRequest = PutDataMapRequest.create(path);
putDataMapRequest.getDataMap().putString(Constants.KEY_CONTENT, content);
putDataMapRequest.getDataMap().putString(Constants.KEY_TITLE, title);
PutDataRequest request = putDataMapRequest.asPutDataRequest();
Wearable.DataApi.putDataItem(mGoogleApiClient, request)
        .setResultCallback(new ResultCallback<DataApi.DataItemResult>() {
            @Override
            public void onResult(DataApi.DataItemResult dataItemResult) {
                if (!dataItemResult.getStatus().isSuccess()) {
                    Log.e(TAG, "buildWatchOnlyNotification(): Failed to set the data, "
                            + "status: " + dataItemResult.getStatus().getStatusCode());
                }
            }
        });
```
